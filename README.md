# OSM4GIS
A physical representation of the OenStreetMap (OSM) Features in a GIS ready format, with layers categorized according to OSM article: (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Primary_features).

The layers attributes have been modeled and normalized to a standard schema to make them consistent for the use of GIS Analysts to query, and create definition queries, and apply symbology while creating their beautiful maps.

The repositories are categorized based on world region then choose the content for specific country to download.

The intention is to keep the data up-to-date.
Currently, the data is updated on a weekly basis (every Friday).

To make the data ready to use, the data has been exported into KML format, in future it will be available in other GIS Open formats such as OGC GeoPackage.
